This code is adapted from Infinite Rainbows, a generative animation by [Marius Watz](http://mariuswatz.com/). The original Actionscript version was commissioned by [POKE](http://pokelondon.com) as part of Good Things Should Never End, an online brand experience for Orange UK.

Good Things Should Never End was included in [MOMA's 2011 "Talk to Me" Exhibition](http://moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/talktome/objects/146216/). Further documentation [can be found in this Flickr set](https://www.flickr.com/photos/watz/albums/72157671288573051).

> On this seemingly endless website— designed by Poke as a promotion for the UK mobile telecommunications company Orange—users can scroll continuously down the screen, following an infinite winding rainbow through a brightly colored landscape littered with zany characters, interactive links, hidden prizes, and animated effects. This world is enriched by opportunities to interact with its denizens: users can click on the characters to chat with them, play games, and explore.
