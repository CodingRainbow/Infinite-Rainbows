# Infinite Rainbows

This code is adapted from Rainbows, a commissioned piece, originally created by [Marius Watz](http://mariuswatz.com/) for [POKE](http://pokelondon.com) as part of an online brand experience for Orange UK.

It was also included in [MOMA's 2011 "Talk to Me" Exhibition](http://moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/talktome/objects/146216/). Further documentation [can be found here on flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/watz/6283617649).

Here is the full project description and credits [as listed on moma.org](http://moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/talktome/objects/146216/).

> On this seemingly endless website— designed by Poke as a promotion for the UK mobile telecommunications company Orange—users can scroll continuously down the screen, following an infinite winding rainbow through a brightly colored landscape littered with zany characters, interactive links, hidden prizes, and animated effects. This world is enriched by opportunities to interact with its denizens: users can click on the characters to chat with them, play games, and explore.
